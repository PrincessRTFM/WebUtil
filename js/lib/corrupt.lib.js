/**
 * Iteratively "corrupt" a string of text from the initial content to the target, one character at a time.
 *
 * Takes two required arguments plus two more optional ones:
 * from - the initial text content
 * to - the final text content
 * extraChars? - the characters to use if the string needs to be grown to match the target content's length
 *               (defaults to all lowercase letters)
 * ignoreExtraCharCase? - whether all letters given in extraChars should be used as both upper and lowercase,
 *                        or if they should be used literally (defaults to true, use both cases even if not
 *                        explicitly given)
 *
 * Returns an iterator object that progressively converts from the initial string to the desired string
