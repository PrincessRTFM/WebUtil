	"Remember: if you see something, say nothing, and drink to forget.",
	"We do not have answers. I am not certain we even have questions.",
	"Some mysteries aren't questions to be answered, but just a kind of opaque fact. A thing which exists to be not known.",
	"Your existence is not impossible. But it's also not very likely.",
	"If at first you don't succeed, look around and find out who is trying to sabotage you with telepathic interference. It is someone you know.",
	"There's nothing under your bed. There's nothing in your closet. Nothing waits in every darkness. Nothing is the most terrifying thing of all.",
	"There is no cause for concern. We're way past that now. If you're not at least feeling mild terror then you haven't been paying attention.",
	"If at first you don't succeed, then you will have alerted them to your presence. It is important that you at first succeed.",
	"There are no dumb questions, only forbidden ones. Your file has been marked for review.",
	"That which does not kill you only wants to watch you suffer a while longer.",
	"Look to the sky. You will not find answers there, but you will certainly see what everyone is screaming about.",
	"Look. Up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. No. It's just the void. Infinite and indifferent. We're so small. So very very small.",
	"Believe in yourself. You are an ancient, absent god, discussed only rarely by literary scholars. So if you don't believe, no one will.",
	"Believe in yourself. Go to a church that worships you. Attend study groups that analyze your words. Argue with others about your existence.",
	"You have nice skin. It really holds in all your blood and organs - no leaking or nothing. You look great.",
	"A partial list of things currently inside you: blood, skull, ghost.",

	"Ignorance may not actually be bliss, but it is certainly less work.",
	"The future is what you make of it. Just know that your supplies are limited.",

	"Confused? Unsure what to do? Sounds like you're human. Good luck.",
	"Fear is consciousness plus life. Regret is an attempt to avoid what has already happened. Toast is bread held under direct heat until crisp.",
	"We have nothing to fear except ourselves. We are unholy, awful people. Fear ourselves with silence.",
	"I fear for anyone caught between what they know, and what they don't yet know that they don't know.",
	"May you find love, wherever it's been hidden. May you find who has been hiding it and enact revenge upon them.",

	"When life seems dangerous and unmanageable, just remember that it is, and that you can't survive forever.",
	"There's a difference between your, you're, and yarn. Yarn isn't even pronounced the same way. It's a completely different word.",
	"Guns don't kill people. It's impossible to be killed by a gun. We are all invincible to bullets and it's a miracle!",
	"Guns don't kill people. Blood loss and organ damage do.",

	"Guns don't kill people. We are all immortal souls living temporarily in shelters of earth and meat.",
	"Guns don't kill people. People kill guns.",
	"A list of things that kill people: 1) conceivably anything. 2) not guns.",
	"First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes nitrate. Then olives. We're not letting you go until you've alphabetized all these nouns.",
	"And now a brief public service announcement. Alligators: can they kill your children? Yes.",
	"The only thing we have to fear is a tarantula hiding in our glove.",
	"Hey, why not take a run? Get that body moving. Take in the fresh air while running. Running away. Fleeing. They're almost upon you.",
	"Is your refridgerator running? I mean dying. I mean the sun. Is the sun dying? Let me start over...",
	"April fools. May idiots. June lunatics. July gibbering husks. By August, there is nothing left of us.",

	"Ask your doctor if earth's gravity is right for you.",
	"Ask your doctor if a chest full of wet leaves and caterpillars is right for you.",
	"I will tell you an important secret. I will also tell you volumes of worthless nonsense. You will never know which is which.",

	"Make like a banana and attract large spiders.",
	"Bury the hatchet. Hide the axe. Ignore the razor. Deny the table saw. Pretend the knife isn't real.",
	"The shortest distance between two points is this cave. It's a really convenient cave. It changes your DNA a bit, but what a time saver.",

	"Ask your doctor if he wants to see a dead body.",
	"You are what you eat. You are a spider 8 times a year.",
	"A word of warning: look. A clause of warning: look out. A phrase of warning: look out for that falling rock. A note of regret: oops. Oh well.",
	"If you love someone, let them go. If they come back, that curse you learned worked.",
	"If you love something, let it go. If it comes back, you're doomed, because it's very hungry.",
	"It takes heart. It takes guts. It also takes cash. It just needs payment asap.",
	"Be the crippling fear you want to see in the world.",

	"Ask your doctor if you are a tree, if we are all trees, if everything is a single being of shared roots and majestic limbs.",
	"Ask your doctor to get away. Ask him to stand back and stop looking directly at you. Ask your doctor if he believes in the devil. Ask him.",
	"Ask your doctor a seemingly innocent question. Tap the side of your nose. Say \u0022perhaps I have said too much.\u0022 Say it again.",
	"Ask your doctor just how many of you there are. Ask her what she told the others. What did she tell the others?",
	"Wow, the continuous nuclear explosion in the sky is really nice today. Hardly any floating water in the way.",
	"Ask your doctor if you're already dead. Ask your doctor if she can even see you. Ask your doctor this while waving your arms. Ask louder.",
